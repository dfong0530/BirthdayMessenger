Birthday Project --> I wanted to create some code where I could store people's birthday and recieve a notification on that day.

This is part two of my project.

This code sends a request to my birthday API to recieve all the birthday's. It then parses the data and sends me a text message if there are any birthday's.

This notification is sent using the Twilio API.

This is scheduled to run everyday at 10:00 am EST using crontab.
